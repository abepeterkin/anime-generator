Use this program to generate a random anime title and publish it to a Tumblr blog!
Compile the project with Maven and run Main in the abe.anime_generator package. 
The argument structure is:

<consumerKey> <consumerSecret> <token> <tokenSecret>

If there are no arguments, the program generates a random title and
prints it to standard output instead of publishing it to a blog.

The dictionary is located in src/titlecards.txt. All words in this version 
were taken from Channel A, a fantastic card game by Asmadi Games.
